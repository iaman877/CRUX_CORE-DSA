How to setup 

-> git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”
-> git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”


SETUP & INIT

-> git init
-> git clone [url]


STAGE & SNAPSHOT

-> git status          // show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit
-> git add [file]      // add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)
-> git reset [file]    // unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory
-> git diff            // diff of what is changed but not staged
-> git diff --staged   // diff of what is staged but not yet committed
-> git commit -m “[message]” // commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot


BRANCH & MERGE

git branch               // list your branches. 
git branch [branch-name] // create a new branch at the current commit
git checkout             // switch to another branch 
git merge [branch]       // merge the specified branch’s history into the current one
git log                  // show all commits in the current branch’s history


SHARE & UPDATE

git remote add [url]
git fetch        // fetch down all the branches from that Git remote
git push origin master 
git pull origin master

TRACKING PATH CHANGES

git rm [file]                     // delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit
git mv [existing-path] [new-path] // change an existing file path and stage the move
git log --stat -M                 // show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved
