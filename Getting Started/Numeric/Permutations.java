/* Suppose (n) number  students are looking to find (r) seats in a classroom so how will they do it . They will do it with simple formula which is given by 
nPr =    n! / (n-r)!
Example :
5P2 means a permutation of 5 things taken 2 at a time. Start with the first number (which in this case is 5), and count down for a total of 2 numbers: 5P2 = 5*4 = 20.
